# Translator
Language Translator GUI with Python and Tkinter
This project demonstrates a Language Translator Graphical User Interface (GUI) created using Python's Tkinter library and the Google Translate API. The GUI allows users to easily translate text from one language to another using a user-friendly interface.

Features
User-Friendly Interface: The application boasts an intuitive and user-friendly design.
Input and Output Text Boxes: Users can enter the text they wish to translate and see the translated output.
Language Selection: Choose the source and target languages from drop-down menus.
Translation Button: A "Translate" button initiates the translation process.
Real-Time Translation: The translated text is displayed instantly in the output box.
Supported Languages: Access a wide range of languages for translation.
Getting Started
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed, as well as the tkinter library for GUI creation and the googletrans library for translation functionality. You can install googletrans using the following command:

Copy code
pip install googletrans==4.0.0-rc1
Running the Application: Execute the script using your Python interpreter. A window will open containing the GUI application.

How it Works
Import Libraries: The script starts by importing necessary libraries including Tkinter, ttk, and googletrans for the translator and language-related functionalities.

Setting up the UI: The GUI window is configured with dimensions, title, and background color. Labels are added for the application title and a friendly message.

Text Boxes and Language Selection: Input and output text boxes are created using Text() widgets. Two comboboxes (src_lang and dest_lang) are used to select the source and target languages. The available languages are populated from the googletrans library.

Translation Function: The Translate() function is defined to handle the translation process. It uses the Google Translate API to translate the input text from the source language to the target language. The translated text is then displayed in the output text box.

Translate Button: A "Translate" button is placed using the Button() widget. It's linked to the Translate() function, so when clicked, it triggers the translation process.

Main Event Loop: The root.mainloop() line starts the main event loop of the Tkinter application, allowing it to respond to user interactions.

Usage
Launch the application by running the script.
Enter the text you want to translate in the input text box.
Select the source language from the dropdown.
Choose the target language from the other dropdown.
Click the "Translate" button to see the translated text in the output text box.
